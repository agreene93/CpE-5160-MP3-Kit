# CpE-5160-MP3-Kit
This is the repository fo the CpE 5160 MP3 kit (Fall 2017)

Notes:
1. In the past Keil Microvision has had problems when the whole directory was uploaded and downloaded.
   To avoid errors, only add, commit, push, and pull *.c file and *.h files.  Keil should displaye the 
   updated files.

2. Set this option first: git config --global core.autocrlf false.  This avoids the "LF will be replaced
   by CRLF" warning that comes up when adding .h files.
